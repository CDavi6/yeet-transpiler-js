# Yeet Transpiler JS 🚀

Welcome to `yeet-transpiler-js`! Dive into a playful project that allows you to express JavaScript in a whimsical way. Why "throw" an error when you can "Yeet" it? And why settle for boring old "Error" when there's "Sus"?

## Features 🌟

- **Custom Syntax**: Experience JavaScript in a fresh, fun manner.
- **Transpilation**: Seamlessly convert your custom-syntax files back to standard JavaScript for execution.

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

### Installation 📦

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/yeet-transpiler-js.git
   ```

2. **Enter the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd yeet-transpiler-js
   ```

3. **Install the necessary packages**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage 🖋

1. **Craft Your Code**: Design files using the custom syntax in the `src` directory. For instance:

   ```javascript
   Yeet new Sus('Just for fun!');
   ```

2. **Transpile**:

   Turn your custom-syntax files into regular JavaScript:

   ```bash
   npm run transpile
   ```

All transpiled JavaScript will reside in the `dist` directory.

3. **Execute**:

   For the default test file:

   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

Or for any other file:
`bash
    node dist/YOUR_FILE_NAME.js
    `
